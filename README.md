# Multi-Resolution Cameras for Blender
This is a minimal Blender add-on written to easily customize resolutions and render your cameras.

After installation, it appears here: `View3D > Sidebar [N] > Render Resolutions`

## Installation

To install this add-on please follow these steps:

1. Download.
1. Open Blender Preferences (CMD+comma on MacOS).
1. Go to the **Add-ons** tab and click `Install`.
1. Browse to the downloaded python script and select it.
1. Enable the script, it is called: `3D View: Multi-Resolution Cameras`.


## Quick Overview

The add-on panel presents a scrollable list, two integer fields with undo buttons, and two render buttons.

For each camera row you will find:

1. Checkbox to create a subset of cameras.
2. The name of the camera.
3. The wrench is filled when the camera has a custom resolution. Click it to restore default scene resolution.
4. The Render Still button will render the camera to `Blender Render` window in the current slot.

Below the list you can click to edit or slide to adjust the resolution of the highlighted camera.

There is also two buttons:

* **Selected**: Renders only the current subset of selected cameras.
* **Renders All**: Yep, you guessed it, this button renders all cameras in the scene.

Using this button will render in the custom resolution is one is set, othewise default resolution will be used.

Please note that changing the scene resolution will **not** automatically update the cameras with default resolution.

Thanks for checking out my first add-on for Blender. I hope you find it useful!

All the best!\

# The Future

I have tried multiple approaches to adding a mesh to the selected camera that shows the resolution of the camera, if it has been customized, but so farâ€”all my attempts have been to no avail. The mest just doesn't show up in the 3D Viewport.

If you can help, please get in touch!
